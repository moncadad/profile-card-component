### What I learned

I learned that the learning process never ends, when i first saw this challenge I though to myself this will be a couple hours project at most.
It pointed out two things that I hadn't realize how little I knew of.
Background and all its properties, position and the remaining spacing it can leave behind.

### Continued development

I managed to better understand the positioning but not the background that still deserves even more attention.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5229081/positionrelative-leaves-an-empty-space) - The spacing I mentioned.
